1- You normally define your connection strings in Web.config. After generating the edmx the connection string will get stored in the App.Config. If you want to change the connection string go to the app.config and remove all the connection strings. Now go to the edmx, right click on the designer surface, select Update model from database, choose the connection string from the dropdown, Click next, Add or Refresh (select what you want) and finish.

2- MAPPING HATASI İÇİN. When you move your Visual Studio solution to another workstation you may encounter the following error message:

System.Data.Entity.Core.MappingException was unhandled by user code
HResult=-2146232032
Message=Schema specified is not valid. Errors:
: error 2062: No mapping specified for instances of the EntitySet and AssociationSet in the EntityContainer …
Source=EntityFramework

 

In this case it may help if you re-import the database objects into the .edmx file.

To import all objects again:

Open the .edmx file,
Press the Ctrl-A keys to select all tables in the diagram,
Press the delete key on the keyboard to delete all tables,
Right click the white area and select Model Browser,
In the Model Browser expand the {model name}.Store, and the Stored Procedures / Functions element
Delete all functions and stored procedures
In the {model name} element (the element above the {model name}.Store) expand the Function Imports element
Delete all function imports
Save the .edmx file
Right click the white area of the .edmx file and select Update Model from Database
Select all necessary tables, stored procedures, and functions and import them.

Dynamic proxy issue with EF and WCF
Problem:
When ever we are querying against an entity (with navigation properties)in EF, we are likely to encounter the below exception.

‘System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.Customers_21E6922CC8E7F8A73D5A7994864A471634C7ABE16025455F28EFDDCB65A9E574’ with data contract name ‘Customers_21E6922CC8E7F8A73D5A7994864A471634C7ABE16025455F28EFDDCB65A9E574:http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies' is not expected.

Solution:
When serializing an entity, it serializes the entity and closes the context before serializing the navigation properties.

Suppose I have Customers entity with navigation properties to Reservations entity. WCF serializes the Customers class and closes the related context and disposes it. But serialization of navigation properties automatically triggers Lazy Loading, now the serialization is happening on the closed context (Customers Context), which results in the above error.

Set the ProxyCreationEnabled to False in the dbContext class constructor.

public TestEntities() : base("name=TestEntities")
{
    base.Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled = false;
}
